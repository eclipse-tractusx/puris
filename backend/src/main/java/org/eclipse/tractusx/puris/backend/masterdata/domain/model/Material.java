/**
 * <p>This class represents materials and products that are to be traded between
 * partners that collaborate via the PURIS application. </p>
 * <p>Whether a material is a product or a "material", is determined by the point of
 * view. If the owner of the current instance of a PURIS application is selling a
 * certain product to customers, the product flag must be set to "true" and the business
 * logic will treat this material as a product if the circumstances require a differentiation
 * between products and materials.</p>
 * <p>If, on the other hand, the owner of the current instance of a PURIS application is buying
 * a material from external partners, then the material-flag must be set to "true", in order to
 * allow the business logic to handle this correctly.</p>
 * <p>This approach allows for flexibility, especially in cases when the the owner of the current
 * instance of a PURIS application is a trader who is buying a certain good from one partner just
 * to sell it immediately to another partner. </p>
 * <p>Each entity of this class is uniquely identified by the material number defined
 * by the partner that runs an instance of the PURIS app.</p>
 * <p>Example: A certain type of semiconductors is produced by partner A. He has labeled his
 * product with the material number "SC-456.001". Partner B is buying this type of
 * semiconductors from A. In his own ERP-System, he is referring to this semiconductor
 * as "A-CHIP-0815".</p>
 * <p>In partner A's PURIS app this material will be registered under the ownMaterialNumber
 * "SC-456.001", while partner B will registered as "A-CHIP-0815". Let's further assume
 * that Partner C now wants to buy this material from A as well. In his own domain, C names
 * this material "XYZ-123". Therefore C will register the material under this ownMaterialNumber
 * in his own PURIS app.</p>
 * <p>When two partners are preparing to establish a business relationship in regard to a specific
 * material, then each partner will create a {@link MaterialPartnerRelation}, where he
 * designates the other partner as supplier or customer of this entity. He also must define,
 * under which material number his partner refers to this material.</p>

# Migration Guide

This migration guide is based on the `chartVersion` of the chart that also bumps the `appVersion` of the application. If you don't rely on the provided helm chart, consider the changes of the chart as mentioned below manually.

## Version 2.8.x to 3.0.0

*This migration guide covers the changes provided from [appVersion 3.0.0 to appVersion 3.1.0](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/compare/3.0.0...3.1.0).*

### Fix of NameOverride

`nameOverride` has been implemented incorrectly so that is not been considered in the templates ([pr#856](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/pull/856)).

As this change is a breaking change (label selectors are immutable) during migrations version [`2.9.0`](#version-28x-to-version-290) SHOULD NOT be used.

The chart in version 3.0.0 deletes the `Deployment` resources of the frontend and backend once pre-upgrade via hook.
This means that the application has a (small downtime).

Alternative ways may be possible.

### Adding YAML Anchor for Frontend URL

There has already been a YAML anchor for the backend url (`global.domain.backend.ingress`).
Now the chart also provides a YAML anchor for the frontend url (`global.domain.frontend.ingress`).

**YOUR TASK**: Consider switching to the new syntax. Your old syntax still works.

### Handling of Protocols HTTP and HTTPS

The default values have been inconsistent. Thus, now `https` is used for defaults.
For Frontend and Backend related urls, the protocol will be defaulted if missing.

**YOUR TASK**: This is just an improvement for fail safety. If your deployment works, you already used a protocol.

### CORS allowed origins

The allowed origins in the backend now must be configured to the frontend. This is an increase in security and has been introduced with the websocket to feedback information to the frontend dynamically (see [pr#847](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/pull/847)).

**YOUR TASK**: You need to configure `backend.puris.allowedOrigins` according to your frontend's ingress address. Please consider the [YAML anchor](#adding-yaml-anchor-for-frontend-url).

### Conformance to CX-0002 "Digital Twins in Catena-X"

We noticed issues in the conformance to digital twins, as you can see in the following PRs:

- fix(submodel-endpoints): throw 501 for operations not implemented [#850](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/pull/850)
- fix: expose and contract submodels following CX-0002 [#849](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/pull/849)
- fix(dtr): register dtr asset with api/v3 prefix [#824](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/pull/824)

This results in the following changes:

- the edc asset of the digital twin registry needs to have `api/v3` appended to `dataAddress.baseUrl`
- the submodel urls have been incorrect for two reasons:
  - all (except for `PartTypeInstance`) had a trailing `/` that must be removed in shell descriptors field `href`.
  - the path segment `submodel` is missing at the end of the shell descriptor's field `href`.

During the fixes, we changed some configurations:

- `backend.puris.dtr.url` now needs to contain the suffix for the v3 api (`/api/v3`)

**YOUR TASK**: You need to update `backend.puris.dtr.url`. We don't provide a migration for the DTR or the EDC. 
Thus, you need to do the following things manually: 

- Terminate existing contracts for the Digital Twin Registry that have been created by PURIS FOSS.
- Follow the instructions in the subchapter

#### TASK Asset update

Either delete the submodel asset for the DTR manually or update according to the definition mentioned above.
If you delete it,

- restart PURIS to create the EDC assets with the correct paths and corresponding contract defintions
- re-register (PUT with the same information) the `material partner reeelationships` (NOTE: read next task first) 

Note: You can identify the asset for the DTR using the `assetId` = `DigitalTwinRegistry@<your BPNL>`.

#### TASK Shell & Submodel Descriptor Updates

You can manually update all Shell and Submodel Descriptors or remove the ones managed by PURIS FOSS.
If you delete them,

- restart PURIS to create the assets with the correct paths and corresponding contract defintions
- re-register (PUT with the same information) the `material partner relationships` (NOTE: read next task first) so that PURIS FOSS creates the Submodel Descriptors with the latest asset Ids and correct paths.

Note: You can determine the technical identifiers for your twins using the following information:

- material (inbound) twin:  See `MaterialPartnerRelationship.partnerCXNumber`
- product (outbound) twin: See `DigitalTwinMapping.productTwinId`

### Further Improvements

- The `jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` setting is set to update only (don't drop tables) and parameter is passthroughed correctly ([pr#838](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/pull/838))

## Version 2.8.x to Version 2.9.0

Chart version 2.9.0 has been incorrectly labeled as non-breaking (see issue). 

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to be used. Instead, refer to migration to [Version 3.0.0](#version-28x-to-version-300).

## Older Versions

[TRG 2.09](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-09) has been introduced with R25.06. Thus, no migration guidelines are provided for older versions.

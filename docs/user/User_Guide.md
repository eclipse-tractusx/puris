# User Guide

This guide explains the overall masks that may be used by different roles.

- A `PURIS_USER` may see and use the material list view, material details view, view this user guide, view the license information and log out.
- A `PURIS_ADMIN` may _additionally_ use the views "Notifications", "Catalog", "Negotiations" and "Transfers".

In the following the views are explained.

## Material list view

![Material List View](img/materials_list_view.png)
The Material List View allows users to quickly search and filter through materials.
It includes the following:

1. A search bar
2. A dropdown menu to select either incoming, outgoing, or any direction of the materials
3. A sortable list of all materials

### Searching materials

The user can find a specific material by using the search bar. The user can search through the materials using the material name or number. By default, it will be searching in any (incoming and outgoing) material direction. The user can choose a specific direction with the “Direction” dropdown.
By using the “Direction” dropdown menu the user can chose to narrow their search to view incoming materials, outgoing materials or both. The “Direction” dropdown can also be used to list all incoming or outgoing materials by leaving the search bar empty.

The user can further sort the materials by material number, material name, days of supply, direction and when they were last updated by clicking on the appropriate headers of the table.
The user can select a material by clicking on it. This will open the Materials Detail View.

## Materials detail view

![Material Detail View](img/materials_detail_view.png)

The Material Detail View allows users to see a detailed view of the selected material. When selecting outgoing materials, the user is viewing their own production and their suppliers' demands. When selecting incoming materials, the user is viewing their own demand and partners' production.

It includes several expandable nested tables presented in the following order, based on the direction of the material:

- When seeing material details for outgoing materials, the following summaries are shown:
  1. Production summary for the material
  2. Production summary at a specific location
- When seeing materials for the incoming direction, the following summaries are shown:
  1. Demand summary for the material
  2. Demand summary at a specific location

### Summary tables

Each overall or location specific summary table is separated into the following sections depending on the direction:

- When seeing materials for the outgoing direction, the following summaries are shown:
  1. A production summary for the material
  2. A collapsible demand summary per customer
  3. A collapsible demand summary per specific location of a customer
- When seeing materials for the incoming direction, the following summaries are shown:
  1. A demand summary for the material
  2. A collapsible production summary per supplier
  3. A collapsible production summary per specific location of a supplier

### Data overview

All the data is available for a 4 calendar-week period displaying the following data for supplier/customer respectively:

- Supplier
  1. Planned production
  2. Outgoing shipments
  3. Projected item stock
  4. Days of Supply
- Customer
  1. Short term material demand
  2. Incoming deliveries
  3. Projected item stock
  4. Days of Supply

Each calendar week is summarised in its own collapsable column. By clicking on the header, the column can be expanded to reveal detailed day to day information.
The user can view the data for an individula cell by clicking on the number.

Negative projected stock values inidicate a problem in the supply and will be marked in red

#### Updating partner data

The displayed data is mostly reported data from the partner. Therefore, it can become outdated.

In order to request an update of the data, the user can click the "Refresh" button at the top right of the section. This will start a request for updated data in the background.

After a short period of time, the user can refresh the page to be presented with the updated data.

_**Note:** The update process can take up to a minute._

#### Scheduling an ERP data update

The data may be updated manually or be updated periodically by the system. Whenever a partner asked for a specific
information OR the user triggered "SCHEDULE ERP UPDATE", then a periodic update is scheduled. It is automatically
cancelled after the update has not been triggered for a configured number of days.

This update is always:

- per partner
- per material
- per information (currently only stock is supported)
- per direction (e.g. stock is differentiated into stock as a customer or supplier)

In case of further information (e.g., update intervals), please contact your administrator or consult the Admin Guide.

### Adding data

In addition to viewing the user's own data, the user can also add new data for the selected material. The buttons for adding new data are located to the top right of the data view.

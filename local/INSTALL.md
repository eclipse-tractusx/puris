# Creating a local testing and development setup via Docker

This guide helps you to run PURIS for local demonstration and testing purposes. You can either choose to use
the "Extended Run Instructions" or to use the "Run with simplified Deployment Script".

**Prerequisites**

- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) -> used to auto generate environment files
- [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (docker & docker compose) -> used for the setup

## Additional information for Windows users

If you want to use the local setup on a Windows machine, it seems advisable to use the Windows subsystem for Linux (
WSL).
An installation guide can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Also see this [additional information about using Docker in combination with WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)

## Run with simplified Deployment Script (Bash)

This script allows easier startup for testing and demonstration.

As a prerequisite, please install the [bruno cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@usebruno/cli) locally via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

> [!NOTE]
> Bruno is an API client alternative to postman. See benefits e.g. in [eclipse-tractusx.github.io](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/tooling#bruno--a-git-friendly-open-source-api-client).

### Build PURIS

Same as for the extended run build PURIS manually.

```shell
cd ../backend
docker build -t puris-backend:dev .

cd ../frontend
docker build -t puris-frontend:dev .

cd ../local
```

Then use the deployment script to fulfill common scenarios:

```shell
cd local

# First run: 
# - generate secrets and keys
# - start infrastructure
# - seed bdrs
# - deploy puris, dtr, edc
# If run again, the existing infrastructure will be reused:
# - remove services for puris, dtr, edc
# - deploy puris, dtr, edc
sh deploy.sh

# deploy PURIS from scratch with a cleanup upfront
sh deploy.sh -c

# same as without any option, but attaches customer and supplier puris backends after successful startup
sh deploy.sh -a

# removes role definition in puris backends and seeds INT test data from scratch with a cleanup upfront
# the customer puris does not seed its own DTR asset and contract. It reuses one added via bruno
sh deploy.sh -i

# redeploy puris but keep infrastructure and show logs of EDC, DTR, PURIS
sh deploy.sh -l


```

The script also checks if the respective services are healthy (sometimes simplified).

But you now need to get logs on your own

```shell
# identify container names
docker container ls

# e.g. puris backend of customer, use '-f' option to follow logs.
docker logs customer-backend
```

## Extended Run Instructions

### Initial Setup

In case you had any previous installations of this project on your machine, it is advisable to remove them via the
script
(see below in the Notes on debugging section).

Run the following script to generate the necessary keys. It will also create an .env file in the ./local folder.
Make sure to have `openssl` and `jq` installed in your shell. openssl is pre-installed on most operating systems. jq can
be
installed via the usual installation repositories, see [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)

```shell
cd local
sh generate-keys.sh
```

## Build

If you are doing a fresh install and everytime you edited the code of the PURIS frontend or backend you have to create a
new build of docker images for the PURIS frontend/backend.

For creating a docker image of the frontend, navigate your shell to the frontend folder and run

```
docker build -t puris-frontend:dev .
```

For creating a docker image of the backend, navigate your shell to the backend folder and run

```
docker build -t puris-backend:dev .
```

Please see the INSTALL.md documents in the [frontend](../frontend/INSTALL.md) and [backend](../backend/INSTALL.md)

The default image tag is 'dev'. Remember to also adjust the tag in the docker-compose.yaml if you want to use different
tags.

## Start

First start the infrastructure by navigating your shell to the local folder and running

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-infrastructure.yaml up
```

<!-- Note: Currently no MIW needed, don't show documentation rendered.
Note: sh init-wallets.sh is temporarily not needed
After the MIW container has finished booting, use this script (also in the local folder) to initialise two wallets for
customer and supplier:

```shell
sh init-wallets.sh
```
-->

After starting the central infrastructure, initialize the bdrs-service. To do so, just run the script `seed-bdrs.sh`
created during the run of script `generate-keys.sh`.

```shell
sh seed-bdrs.sh
```

Then start the PURIS demonstrator containers via:

```shell
docker compose up
```

Wait for the startup and visit http://localhost:3000/ for the customer's frontend or http://localhost:3001/ for the
supplier side.

Whenever you have edited the source code in the frontend or backend and you want to test these changes, we recommend
that you
stop all the containers, which are not part of the infrastructure, by deleting the volumes, i.e. run

```
docker compose down -v
```

Then, build a new docker image for the respective component (frontend and/or backend) as described above and then
restart via

```shell
docker compose up
```

In general, it is not necessary to restart the infrastructure, if you had to rebuild frontend or backend.
However, in rare cases there may be issues with the MIW. If this
happens, you should use the cleanup script as mentioned in the debugging section below and then repeat the
above-mentioned
steps beginning with the Initial Setup section.

## Notes on debugging

### Vault & Certs

When having problems with the certs or the vault, one may need to delete the vault container.
The following script stops all infrastructure containers as well as the PURIS demonstrator containers:

```shell
cd local
sh cleanup.sh
```

Then start your containers again with the aforementioned commands.

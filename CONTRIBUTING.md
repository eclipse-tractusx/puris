# Contributing to Eclipse Tractus-X

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The companies involved want to increase the automotive industry's
competitiveness, improve efficiency through industry-specific cooperation and
accelerate company processes through standardization and access to information
and data. A special focus is also on SMEs, whose active participation is of
central importance for the network's success. That is why Catena-X has been
conceived from the outset as an open network with solutions ready for SMEs,
where these companies will be able to participate quickly and with little IT
infrastructure investment. Tractus-X is meant to be the PoC project of the
Catena-X alliance focusing on parts traceability.

## Known Knows

### Data Sovereignty

Currently, edc assets are always configured to match exactly one kind policy. These policies can be defined during
deployment (see [Admin Guide](docs/admin/Admin_Guide.md)). Data is offered to each partner, who has been added to
the PURIS FOSS's master data pool depending on the business relationship (partner is a customer / supplier).

For productive use, the following features should be implemented:

- configuration of contracts including accepting and refusing contracts via UI
- more user-friendly configuration of contracts including bi-lateral contracts
